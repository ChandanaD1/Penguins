## Inspiration
Many of us on the team are applying for college, and have encountered many situations where we found that the resources we had were vital. We realized that FGLI students who are going through this process may not have access to similar resources due to various reasons. For instance, since they are the first-generation in their family to pursue higher education, they may not receive much support from their families or school.

## What it does
Our platform, NextGen College aims to bridge the gap between FGLI students and higher education. We have created a personalized mentor-mentee matching system that will allow FGLI students to receive assistance in their college application process.

## How we built it
We built our website using the Django framework in order to collect large amounts of user data. For the front-end we utilized HTML, JavaScript, CSS. We split up the duties based on our team members' strengths in either front-end or back-end development.

## Challenges we ran into
Django was a difficult framework to manage because it had so many components and it was difficult to use in a team setting. However, after thorough research, we narrowed down the large scope of Django and were able to persevere.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are incredibly proud of our ability to create this project within a week. Our team demonstrated a lot of dedication through our daily meetings, flexibility, and patience.

## What we learned
Each member had strengths in diverse areas, so we could each learn from each other. We learned how to utilize a shared GitHub repository in order to facilitate a open-source project.

## What's next for NextGen College
Our team plans to add more features in order to make the matching process more efficient until we can deploy it for students to use. We also hope to expand the resources we provide, so students get a greater variety of benefits.
